#### What I Learned!! 🧐
## What is Machine Learning ? 🤖
Machine Learning is the Science of getting machines learn on their own without explicitly programming every conditions, machine learning uses various algorithms (statistical or computational algorithms) to learn from data and to understand data patterns/relationships. The Final trained ML model then takes new compatible data as input, and gives outputs acc. to patterns.

## Why we need Machine Learning? 🦾

* To make machines perform tasks that are Hard to describe directly to those machines.
* The **Goal** of ML is to make machines act more & mroe like Humans.

## Buzz Words: DS/ AI / ML 📊

As I Learned they all are closely related by the means of data.

* **Data Science**: The Science and techniques to make use of data. Converting useless data into useful insights by various statistical Experiments, Domain Knowledge etc. 

* **AI :** Different field to equipe machines with intelligence, to make machines like humans by having artificially created intelligence. It Contains ML as a Subset.

* **Machine Learning :** As mentioned earlier, process of making machines learn from data.

**I consider "Data Science" as the Superset of ML.**

## Why "Data Science" & "Machine Learning" got this importance 👨‍💻 :

  ### Big Data 💽: 
  As the field of IT evolved the amount of data we generate evolved exponentially.

  This way Big data came into existence.

  * It's Characterized by 3 'V's :
    
    **Volume, Variety, Velocity**.
    
    Large **Volumes** of data with several **varieties** started to generate with large **velocities.**

Big Data's complexity made it difficult to approach data with traditional techniques only. This led to the emergence of **Data Science**.

The challenges in predicting, decision-making, and leveraging Big data directly led to the rise of **Machine Learning**.

Also Increased **computing power** and resources have facilitated complex computations, making Data Science and ML more accessible and efficient.

## Types of ML 🌱:

1. **Supervised Learning :** Using labelled, input-output mapped data to train models.
2. **Unsupervised Learning :** Making use of unlabelled data to train ML models by recognizing patterns & groups.
3. **Reinforced Learning :** Kind of reward-punish learning. Machine itself try, get errors & improves itself. Machine Learns by reinforcing itself with data.
