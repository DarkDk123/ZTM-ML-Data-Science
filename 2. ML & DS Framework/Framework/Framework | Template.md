# Creating a FrameWork : 🚀📚

A FrameWork or Template will Standardize the approaches & steps followed in a real-world **ML & DS** project. 📊🔍

We will get in detail both ML Framework and DS Framework.

We will majorly follow the projects approach, learning by doing projects. 👨‍💻🏗️

## Machine Learning Framework : 🤖📚

## **1. Problem Identification :** 🎯
* What category of problem we are dealing with ?? 🤔
* What Actual Problem we have to tackle ? 🤨

#### At First, we must understand the problem or even it need Machine Learning to be solved?? ❓
Choose a Simple hand-coded Systems if you can. 👨‍💻

Use ML only if the problem is hard to explain in instruction steps. 🧠

#### Understand the Problem & try to map it with most common ML Problems, try to categorize them among the following common problems. 🔍

1. **Supervised Learning :** In these problems, we have the data with required inputs and mapped outputs to them. 

    Based on this multiple **inputs -> Output** pairs the ML Algorithm tries different patterns until it gets the same output in the training data then it completes it's training. 🔄
    
    ### It has mainly 2 types of subproblems: 📋

    **A. Classification :** It tends to Classify things into different classes/categories. Simply tells the "input" belongs from this type or another. 🗂️
    
    They are further divided based on the number of classes to predict.

    **B. Regression :** It typically predicts a **number**, based on other variables the target would represent how much value. 📉

    It quantifies all variables to predict the numerical value of target.

2. **Unsupervised Learning :** By the name, these problems contain data that is unlabelled, we don't know what to predict!. 🤷‍♂️

That way we directly understand the patterns in data, commonalities in the data points and then we label them acc. to our need.

#### This Problems contain following common problems: 🗃️

**A. Clustering :** Creating different groups of data based on their similarities.

**B. Association rule Mining :** It understands the frequency of pairs of data points, by getting this combinations of data points. It provides the necessary associations & relations among data points.


3. **Transfer Learning :** It is the type of learning which is transfered from a pre-trained model.

    It's used in case when we know, we can use Learnings by previous models to make our new model excellent. This Learnings from one model is **transfered** to another model. 🔄

4. **Reinforced Learning :** When we want our machine to master one thing based on its wins & losses, we give it rewards if it does something good, else we punish it. 
   
    This way machine try to maximize the reward and learns to do the best for maximum rewards. 🎮🏆

## **2. Data :** 🎯
