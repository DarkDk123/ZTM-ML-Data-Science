### **What is Scikit-learn ?**

It's a Python library used for creating **machine learning models**, it has lots of built-int machine learning models to use.

We just need to have our cleaned Data and fit that into our desired Machine Learning Algorithm to get our trained model.

Sk-learn is also used for **evaluate** trained ML models.

### **Benefits of Sk-learn :**

- Uses Python and is based on Numpy, matplotlib. **(easy & familiar)**
- Various Built-in **ML** models (Algorithms).
- Various **Model Evaluation** methods.
- Excellent & Easy **API** to use.

#### Next, we revised ML basics, and other new Sci-kit learn concepts are in next Notebooks.
