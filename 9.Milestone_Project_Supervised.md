# **Heart Disease Prediction & Analysis**

## The completed project is hosted as a separate Github repository [here](https://github.com/DarkDk123/Simple-Heart-disease-classification).


The aim of this project is to utilize the *Cleveland heart disease* dataset to understand how medical attributes of a person contribute to heart-related diseases. We perform a detailed data analysis and create a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a person has heart disease or not, based on their medical attributes.

This is a binary classification task. Detailed explanations of the medical attributes are provided in the Jupyter [Notebook](https://github.com/DarkDk123/Simple-Heart-disease-classification/blob/main/Heart-disease-model.ipynb).

This project is a milestone in the [Data Science/ML course](https://github.com/DarkDk123/ZTM-ML-Data-Science) by ZTM.

## Dataset

The dataset contains medical records of 303 patients collected during their follow-up period, with each patient profile having 13 clinical characteristics and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Procedural Workflow

Here is an overview of the procedural steps performed throughout this project:

1. **Problem Definition**: Defining the objective of predicting heart disease.
2. **Data Collection & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gathering data and performing initial analysis.
3. **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling. The data was already preprocessed.
4. **Model Selection, Training, and Validation**: Choosing appropriate models and validating their performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Filtering**: Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.
6. **Final Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the final model on the test dataset.
7. **Prediction and Interpretation**: Making predictions and interpreting the results.
